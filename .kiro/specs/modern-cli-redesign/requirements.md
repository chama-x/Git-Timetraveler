# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Redesign Git Timetraveler as an elegant, intuitive CLI tool that makes backdating commits feel natural and effortless. Focus on the essential user workflows: committing existing work to past dates, creating historical activity, and managing GitHub presence with minimal friction.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Effortless First-Time Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to get started immediately without complex configuration, so that I can focus on my actual goal rather than tool setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the tool for the first time THEN the system SHALL automatically detect their Git identity and offer to use it
2. WHEN the user needs GitHub access THEN the system SHALL guide them to create a token with clear, minimal steps
3. WHEN the user provides a token THEN the system SHALL securely store it for future sessions
4. WHEN the user wants to change their stored token THEN the system SHALL provide a simple reset command
5. IF the user has multiple Git identities THEN the system SHALL let them choose which to use as the commit author

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Repository Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool to work seamlessly with my existing repositories and create new ones when needed, so that I don't have to manually manage repository setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is in a Git repository THEN the system SHALL detect it and offer to use the current repo
2. WHEN the user specifies a repository that doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL offer to create it on GitHub
3. WHEN the user wants to select a branch THEN the system SHALL show available branches and let them choose
4. WHEN the user works with an existing repository THEN the system SHALL safely integrate without overwriting existing history
5. IF the user wants to work with a remote repository THEN the system SHALL clone it temporarily and push changes back

### Requirement 3: Flexible Commit Authoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to choose how commits are attributed and what content they contain, so that I can create meaningful historical activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user creates a commit THEN the system SHALL let them choose between their Git identity or a generic "time traveler" identity
2. WHEN the user has staged files THEN the system SHALL offer to commit those files to a specified past date
3. WHEN the user wants to create new content THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate placeholder files for the target date
4. WHEN the user specifies commit details THEN the system SHALL allow custom commit messages with smart defaults
5. IF the user wants to commit as themselves THEN the system SHALL use their configured Git name and email

### Requirement 4: Simple Date and Time Selection

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily specify when commits should appear in history, so that I can create the exact timeline I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user specifies a date THEN the system SHALL accept natural formats like "1990", "Jan 1990", or "1990-01-01"
2. WHEN the user wants multiple dates THEN the system SHALL support ranges like "1990-1995" and lists like "1990,1992,1994"
3. WHEN the user doesn't specify a time THEN the system SHALL use a reasonable default (like 6 PM)
4. WHEN the user creates multiple commits THEN the system SHALL distribute them naturally across the specified timeframe
5. IF the user wants precise timing THEN the system SHALL accept full timestamps

### Requirement 5: Clear Progress and Feedback

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand what the tool is doing and see clear results, so that I can trust the process and verify the outcome.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs any operation THEN the system SHALL show clear progress with meaningful status messages
2. WHEN the user completes an operation THEN the system SHALL display a summary of what was created
3. WHEN the user encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide specific, actionable error messages
4. WHEN the user wants to preview changes THEN the system SHALL offer a dry-run mode
5. IF the user wants detailed information THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging options

### Requirement 6: Smart Defaults and Memory

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool to remember my preferences and provide intelligent defaults, so that repeated use becomes faster and more convenient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the tool repeatedly THEN the system SHALL remember their preferred repository, branch, and author settings
2. WHEN the user works in different projects THEN the system SHALL adapt defaults based on the current Git context
3. WHEN the user has established patterns THEN the system SHALL suggest similar operations
4. WHEN the user wants to change defaults THEN the system SHALL provide a simple configuration interface
5. IF the user wants to start fresh THEN the system SHALL provide easy reset options

### Requirement 7: Safety and Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the tool confidently without fear of damaging my repositories or GitHub account, so that I can experiment and iterate safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user performs potentially destructive operations THEN the system SHALL require explicit confirmation
2. WHEN the user's token lacks necessary permissions THEN the system SHALL detect this and provide clear guidance
3. WHEN the user makes mistakes THEN the system SHALL provide options to undo or clean up changes
4. WHEN the user works with existing repositories THEN the system SHALL create backups or use safe branching strategies
5. IF the user encounters authentication issues THEN the system SHALL provide helpful troubleshooting without exposing sensitive data
